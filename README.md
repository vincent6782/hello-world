Mouth-watering
I am a young enthisiast i would say because i have been optimistic about the things i see around me
I am not tring to be boastful, it is the bitter truth
I take a review of my life and nothing makes sense to me that i beging to wonder what is my purpose in life
I don't know if i have made the right decision, but i know it is worth the shot
There is more to what that meets the eyes
Every finished line is the beginning of a new race
No pain, no gain
